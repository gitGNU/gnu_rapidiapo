# If you change the autopackage but not the software itself,
# increment this number.

# PackageVersion: 2

# This is the version of the autopackage runtime this package is
# written for. Increasing this number implies you have read the
# "Migrating to 1.X" document and understand the impact it will have
# on your package. Some APIs may change their behaviour and new
# features will be enabled depending on what this is set to.
AutopackageTarget: 1.2

# Only uncomment InterfaceVersion if your package exposes interfaces
# to other software, for instance if it includes DSOs or python/perl
# modules. See the developer guide for more info, or ask on
# autopackage-dev if you aren't sure about interface versioning.
#
# InterfaceVersion: 0.0

[BuildPrepare]
# For ./configure based systems this is a good default
#prepareBuild --with-some-feature
prepareBuild --enable-static

[BuildUnprepare]
unprepareBuild

[Globals]
# Anything put here will be run during makeinstall and at
# install/uninstall time. Define useful variables here:

# export MY_VAR=1

[Imports]
# You may wish to delete some things first, eg libtool .la files or
# development files (headers)

# rm -r include
# rm libs/*.la

# This imports every file in 
# (ie, that is installed by "make install")
echo '*' | import


[Prepare]
# Dependency checking

# You can use "require" and "recommend". They both try to find the
# given dependency, and install it if missing. But require will return
# 1 (causing failure) if it can't do that whereas recommend will
# simply show a notice at the end of the install.

# The second argument here identifies a skeleton file, which is
# a file that encapsulates a dependency check. The second number
# identifies the interface version you need. Use as many of these
# as you need.

#require @whatever.you/need 1.0
#TODO: SDL dependencies?

# The user may have already installed the program from an RPM.
# Let's try and uninstall it first. We only need one call if 3rd party
# packages have split the program up into multiple packages.

#removeOwningPackage $PREFIX/bin/my-program

[Install]
# Put your installation script here. See the quickstart guide on
# the website for an API cheat-sheet
installExe bin/*

[Uninstall]
# Usually just the following line is enough to uninstall everything
uninstallFromLog
