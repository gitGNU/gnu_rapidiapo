You have lots of pictures. You want to put them on a CD and show them
to your friends. But you would like to provide them with an image
viewer, and a way to select in what order they can should the pictures
by default. Of course, the pictures still can be viewed with other
applications. How can do that? With Rapidiapo!

Rapidiapo is a _single_ executable file that you place in your
pictures directory, and it will automatically load them, with nice
transition effects. It can't be more simple!

Rapidiapo provides binaries for multiple platforms, including
GNU/Linux and MS Woe.
